## What Does It Do

* When a user clicks on the 'add to cart' button on a product you specify, the product will be added to cart and a yes/no popup will be shown asking if the user is also interested in a complementary product (configurable).

* For complementary product that the product type is **SIMPLE**: If the user clicks yes, the complementary product will also be added to cart.

* For complementary product that the product type is **VARIABLE**: If the user clicks yes, you can choose whether to redirect your user to the complementary product's product page, OR to let your user choose a variant on the popup and add that variant to cart without navigating away from popup.

* After the product you upsell & cross sell is added to user's cart, you can choose whether to redirect user to cart page, checkout page, or make them stay on the same page.

* If the user clicks no, you can also choose to redirect the user to cart page, checkout page, or stay on the same page.

* Popup will fire when user adds a product to cart from shop page, product category page, or single product page.

* **(NEW!)** Now you can easily turn AJAX on and off for add to cart button on single product pages!
